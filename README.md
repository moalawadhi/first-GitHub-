# Project Title

**Factors Influencing Water Quality Monitoring**

## Description

This project explores the various factors that influence drinking water quality, focusing on the development of effective monitoring and change detection systems. The goal is to enhance the detection of anomalies in water quality data, enabling timely interventions by water supply companies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is provided by Th√ºringer Fernwasserversorgung. It includes time series data of water quality indicators such as temperature, pH, chlorine levels, and turbidity, measured at various points in the water distribution system.

## Analysis

The analysis involves implementing a change detection system to identify shifts in water quality over time. Key findings include the identification of significant anomalies related to water quality indicators, which can alert water supply companies to potential issues.
